## Active Tasks

### Primary Task
- **Task**: Autonomous Development - REQ-7.1 Specification & Decision
- **Started**: 2026-01-31 23:00
- **Current Phase**: Step 4 - Autonomous New Feature Development
- **Status**: Created REQ-7.1 Enhanced Resilience specification
- **Summary**:
  - ✅ Feature gap analysis complete
  - ✅ REQ-7.1 specification created (Enhanced Never Give Up Resilience)
  - ✅ 4 new components designed: StrategyExplorer, ParallelExecutor, FailurePatternAnalyzer, CreativeSolver
  - 📊 Estimated: ~2000 lines code, 73+ tests, 3-4 days effort
  - 🤔 Decision point: Implement now or defer to next session
- **Next Action**: Finalize autonomous development session, commit specification

### Parallel Tasks
- None (Phase 6.1 completed sequentially)
